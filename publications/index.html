            <p>The automatic synthesis of biomedical publications catalyzes a profound research interest elicited by literature congestion. Current sequence-to-sequence models mainly rely on the lexical surface and seldom consider the deep semantic interconnections between the entities mentioned in the source document. Such superficiality translates into fabricated, poorly informative, redundant, and near-extractive summaries that severely restrict their real-world application in biomedicine, where the specialized jargon and the convoluted facts further emphasize task complexity. To fill this gap, we argue that the summarizer should acquire semantic interpretation over input, exploiting structured and unambiguous representations to capture and conserve the most relevant parts of the text content. This paper presents CogitoErgoSumm, the first framework for biomedical abstractive summarization equipping large pre-trained language models with rich semantic graphs. Precisely, we infuse graphs from two complementary semantic parsing techniques with different goals and granularities—Event Extraction and Abstract Meaning Representation, also designing a reward signal to maximize information content preservation through reinforcement learning. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the CDSR dataset show that our solution achieves competitive performance according to multiple metrics, despite using 2.5x fewer parameters. Results and ablation studies indicate that our joint text-graph model generates more enlightening, readable, and consistent summaries.</p>

            <p>Long document summarization poses obstacles to current generative transformer-based models because of the broad context to process and understand. Indeed, detecting long-range dependencies is still challenging for today’s state-of-the-art solutions, usually requiring model expansion at the cost of an unsustainable demand for computing and memory capacities. This paper introduces Emma, a novel efficient memory-enhanced transformer-based architecture. By segmenting a lengthy input into multiple text fragments, our model stores and compares the current chunk with previous ones, gaining the capability to read and comprehend the entire context over the whole document with a fixed amount of GPU memory. This method enables the model to deal with theoretically infinitely long documents, using less than 18 and 13 GB of memory for training and inference, respectively. We conducted extensive performance analyses and demonstrate that Emma achieved competitive results on two datasets of different domains while consuming significantly less GPU memory than competitors do, even in low-resource settings.</p>

            <p>This paper studies the problem of detecting human beings in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions using an ultra-wideband radar. We perform an extensive measurement campaign in realistic environments, considering different body orientations, the obstacles’ materials, and radar–obstacle distances. We examine two main scenarios according to the radar position: (i) placed on top of a mobile cart; (ii) handheld at different heights. We empirically analyze and compare several input representations and machine learning (ML) methods—supervised and unsupervised, symbolic and non-symbolic—according to both their accuracy in detecting NLOS human beings and their adaptability to unseen cases. Our study proves the effectiveness and flexibility of modern ML techniques, avoiding environment-specific configurations and benefiting from knowledge transference. Unlike traditional TLC approaches, ML allows for generalization, overcoming limits due to unknown or only partially known observation models and insufficient labeled data, which usually occur in emergencies or in the presence of time/cost constraints.</p>

            <p>Biomedical events represent complex, graphical, and semantically rich interactions expressed in the scientific literature. Almost all contributions in the event realm orbit around semantic parsing, usually employing discriminative architectures and cumbersome multi-step pipelines limited to a small number of target interaction types. We present the first lightweight framework to solve both event extraction and event verbalization with a unified text-to-text approach, allowing us to fuse all the resources so far designed for different tasks. To this end, we present a new event graph linearization technique and release highly comprehensive event-text paired datasets, covering more than 150 event types from multiple biology subareas (English language). By streamlining parsing and generation to translations, we propose baseline transformer model results according to multiple biomedical text mining benchmarks and NLG metrics. Our extractive models achieve greater state-of-the-art performance than single-task competitors and show promising capabilities for the controlled generation of coherent natural language utterances from structured data.</p>

            <p>Driven by deep learning breakthroughs, natural language generation (NLG) models have been at the center of steady progress in the last few years, with a ubiquitous task influence. However, since our ability to generate human-indistinguishable artificial text lags behind our capacity to assess it, it is paramount to develop and apply even better automatic evaluation metrics. To facilitate researchers to judge the effectiveness of their models broadly, we introduce NLG-Metricverse—an end-to-end open-source library for NLG evaluation based on Python. Our framework provides a living collection of NLG metrics in a unified and easy-to-use environment, supplying tools to efficiently apply, analyze, compare, and visualize them. This includes (i) the extensive support to heterogeneous automatic metrics with n-arity management, (ii) the meta-evaluation upon individual performance, metric-metric and metric-human correlations, (iii) graphical interpretations for helping humans better gain score intuitions, (iv) formal categorization and convenient documentation to accelerate metrics understanding. NLG-Metricverse aims to increase the comparability and replicability of NLG research, hopefully stimulating new contributions in the area.</p>

            <p>Combining structured knowledge and neural language models to tackle natural language processing tasks is a recent research trend that catalyzes community attention. This integration holds a lot of potential in document summarization, especially in the biomedical domain, where the jargon and the complex facts make the overarching information truly hard to interpret. In this context, graph construction via semantic parsing plays a crucial role in unambiguously capturing the most relevant parts of a document. However, current works are limited to extracting open-domain triples, failing to model real-world n-ary and nested biomedical interactions accurately. To alleviate this issue, we present EASumm, the first framework for biomedical abstractive summarization enhanced by event graph extraction (i.e., graphical representations of medical evidence learned from scientific text), relying on dual text-graph encoders. Extensive evaluations on the CDSR dataset corroborate the importance of explicit event structures, with better or comparable performance than previous state-of-the-art systems. Finally, we offer some hints to guide future research in the field.</p>

            <p>The latest batch of research has equipped language models with the ability to attend over relevant and factual information from non-parametric external sources, drawing a complementary path to architectural scaling. Besides mastering language, exploiting and contextualizing the latent world knowledge is crucial in complex domains like biomedicine. However, most works in the field rely on general-purpose models supported by databases like Wikipedia and Books. We introduce BioReader, the first retrieval-enhanced text-to-text model for biomedical natural language processing. Our domain-specific T5-based solution augments the input prompt by fetching and assembling relevant scientific literature chunks from a neural database with \mbox≈60 million tokens centered on PubMed. We fine-tune and evaluate BioReader on a broad array of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming several state-of-the-art methods despite using up to 3x fewer parameters. In tandem with extensive ablation studies, we show that domain knowledge can be easily altered or supplemented to make the model generate correct predictions bypassing the retraining step and thus addressing the literature overload issue.</p>

            <p>In knowledge graph representation learning, link prediction is among the most popular and influential tasks. Its surge in popularity has resulted in a panoply of orthogonal embedding-based methods projecting entities and relations into low-dimensional continuous vectors. To further enrich the research space, the community witnessed a prolific development of evaluation benchmarks with a variety of structures and domains. Therefore, researchers and practitioners face an unprecedented challenge in effectively identifying the best solution to their needs. To this end, we propose the most comprehensive and up-to-date study to systematically assess the effectiveness and efficiency of embedding models for knowledge graph completion. We compare 13 models on six datasets with different sizes, domains, and relational properties, covering translational, semantic matching, and neural network-based encoders. A fine-grained evaluation is conducted to compare each technique head-to-head in terms of standard metrics, training and evaluation times, memory consumption, carbon footprint, and space geometry. Our results demonstrate the high dependence between performance and graph types, identifying the best options for each scenario. Among all the encoding strategies, the new generation of translational models emerges as the most promising, bringing out the best and most consistent results across all the datasets and evaluation criteria.</p>

            <p>Motivation: The scientific literature embeds an enormous amount of relational knowledge, encompassing interactions between biomedical entities, like proteins, drugs, and symptoms. To cope with the ever-increasing number of publications, researchers are experiencing a surge of interest in extracting valuable, structured, concise, and unambiguous information from plain texts. With the development of deep learning, the granularity of information extraction is evolving from entities and pairwise relations to events. Events can model complex interactions involving multiple participants having a specific semantic role, also handling nested and overlapping definitions. After being studied for years, automatic event extraction is on the road to significantly impact biology in a wide range of applications, from knowledge base enrichment to the formulation of new research hypotheses. Results: This paper provides a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on the link between event extraction and natural language understanding, focusing on the biomedical domain. First, we establish a flexible event definition, summarizing the terminological efforts conducted in various areas. Second, we present the event extraction task, the related challenges, and the available annotated corpora. Third, we deeply explore the most representative methods and present an analysis of the current state-of-the-art, accompanied by performance discussion. To help researchers navigate the avalanche of event extraction works, we provide a detailed taxonomy for classifying the contributions proposed by the community. Fourth, we compare solutions applied in biomedicine with those evaluated in other domains, identifying research opportunities and providing insights for strategies not yet explored. Finally, we discuss applications and our envisions about future perspectives, moving the needle on explainability and knowledge injection.</p>

            <p>The automatic extraction of biomedical events from the scientific literature has drawn keen interest in the last several years, recognizing complex and semantically rich graphical interactions otherwise buried in texts. However, very few works revolve around learning embeddings or similarity metrics for event graphs. This gap leaves biological relations unlinked and prevents the application of machine learning techniques to promote discoveries. Taking advantage of recent deep graph kernel solutions and pre-trained language models, we propose Deep Divergence Event Graph Kernels (DDEGK), an unsupervised inductive method to map events into low-dimensional vectors, preserving their structural and semantic similarities. Unlike most other systems, DDEGK operates at a graph level and does not require task-specific labels, feature engineering, or known correspondences between nodes. To this end, our solution compares events against a small set of anchor ones, trains cross-graph attention networks for drawing pairwise alignments (bolstering interpretability), and employs transformer-based models to encode continuous attributes. Extensive experiments have been done on nine biomedical datasets. We show that our learned event representations can be effectively employed in tasks such as graph classification, clustering, and visualization, also facilitating downstream semantic textual similarity. Empirical results demonstrate that DDEGK significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</p>

            <p>Though the strong evolution of knowledge learning models has characterized the last few years, the explanation of a phenomenon from text documents, called descriptive text mining, is still a difficult and poorly addressed problem. The need to work with unlabeled data, explainable approaches, unsupervised and domain independent solutions further increases the complexity of this task. Currently, existing techniques only partially solve the problem and have several limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology of descriptive text mining, capable of offering accurate explanations in unsupervised settings and of quantifying the results based on their statistical significance. Considering the strong growth of patient communities on social platforms such as Facebook, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the contribution by taking the short social posts related to Esophageal Achalasia as a typical case study. Specifically, the methodology produces useful explanations about the experiences of patients and caregivers. Starting directly from the unlabeled patient’s posts, we derive correct scientific correlations among symptoms, drugs, treatments, foods and so on.</p>

            <p>Learning knowledge from text is becoming increasingly important as the amount of unstructured content on the Web rapidly grows. Despite recent breakthroughs in natural language understanding, the explanation of phenomena from textual documents is still a difficult and poorly addressed problem. Additionally, current NLP solutions often require labeled data, are domain-dependent, and based on black box models. In this paper, we introduce POIROT, a new descriptive text mining methodology for phenomena explanation from documents corpora. POIROT is designed to provide accurate and interpretable results in unsupervised settings, quantifying them based on their statistical significance. We evaluated POIROT on a medical case study, with the aim of learning the “voice of patients” from short social posts. Taking Esophageal Achalasia as a reference, we automatically derived scientific correlations with 79% F1-measure score and built useful explanations of the patients’ viewpoint on topics such as symptoms, treatments, drugs, and foods. We make the source code and experiment details publicly available.</p>

            <p>The use of knowledge graphs (KGs) in advanced applications is constantly growing, as a consequence of their ability to model large collections of semantically interconnected data. The extraction of relational facts from plain text is currently one of the main approaches for the construction and expansion of KGs. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised and automatic technique of KG learning from corpora of short unstructured and unlabeled texts. Our approach is unique in that it starts from raw textual data and comes to: i) identify a set of relevant domain-dependent terms; ii) extract aggregate and statistically significant semantic relationships between terms, documents and classes; iii) represent the accurate probabilistic knowledge as a KG; iv) extend and integrate the KG according to the Linked Open Data vision. The proposed solution is easily transferable to many domains and languages as long as the data are available. As a case study, we demonstrate how it is possible to automatically learn a KG representing the knowledge contained within the conversational messages shared on social networks such as Facebook by patients with rare diseases, and the impact this can have on creating resources aimed to capture the “voice of patients”.</p>

            <p>Rare diseases pose particular challenges to patients, families, caregivers, clinicians and researchers. Due to the scarce availability of information and their disintegration, in recent years we are witnessing a strong growth of patient communities on social platforms such as Facebook. Although the data generated in this context are of high value, the currently existing ontologies and resources tend to ignore them. The work presented in this paper studies how to extract knowledge from the large availability of unstructured text generated by the users over time, in order to represent it in an organized way and to make logical reasoning above. Starting from the awareness of the need to integrate different methodologies in complex domains, the research shows a combined use of Text Mining and Semantic Web techniques. In particular, we describe the basis of a novel approach for Knowledge Graph Learning with the aim of introducing a patient-centered vision into the world of Linked Open Data. By identifying and representing correlations between concepts of interest, we show how it is possible to answer patients’ questions and provide them with an additional tool for decision making. The outlined contribute minimizes costs through automatic data retrieval and increases the productivity of investigators.</p>
