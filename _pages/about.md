I'm a third-year PhD Student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI), University of Bologna, Italy. 

🎯 I investigate how to <b>combine language models and structured knowledge</b> for <b>Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLP/NLU)</b>. My research interests comprise semantic parsing, graph representation and similarity learning, knowledge injection, retrieval-enhanced language modeling, and joint text-graph reasoning. I presented several original papers to international journals and peer-reviewed conferences—including top-tier venues like EMNLP, AAAI, and COLING, winning two Best Paper Awards. My contributions cover many real-world tasks, from open-domain question answering to document summarization.

🧬 In September 2016, I discovered to suffer from a rare disease called "Esophageal Achalasia." Since then, I have dedicated myself to merging my skills and patient-centered experience to build innovative data analysis solutions for research advancement in Health domains.

In 2020, I was among the worldwide selected program attendees at the Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School. In the same year, I received the con.Scienze Award for writing one of the ten best Italian scientific research works during the master's thesis. In September—December 2022, I was a visiting postgraduate researcher at the University of Glasgow, School of Computing Science, Scotland. Since 2022, I have been an HuggingFace and Streamlit Student Ambassador.

I belong to a research group led by <b>Prof. Gianluca Moro</b>. Together with my colleagues, we design and develop state-of-the-art NLP solutions pursuing a vision focused on concretizing the much-desired birth of a new generation of artificial understanding, learning, explicit knowledge representation, and reasoning.
