I'm a third-year PhD Student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DISI), University of Bologna, Italy. 

ðŸŽ¯ I investigate how to <b>combine language models and structured knowledge</b> for <b>Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLP/NLU)</b>. My research interests comprise semantic parsing, graph representation and similarity learning, knowledge injection, retrieval-enhanced language modeling, and joint text-graph reasoning. I presented several original papers to international journals and peer-reviewed conferencesâ€”including top-tier venues like EMNLP, AAAI, and COLING, winning two Best Paper Awards. My contributions cover many real-world tasks, from open-domain question answering to document summarization.

ðŸ§¬ In September 2016, I discovered to suffer from a rare disease called "Esophageal Achalasia." Since then, I have dedicated myself to merging my skills and patient-centered experience to build innovative data analysis solutions for research advancement in Health domains.

In 2020, I was among the worldwide selected program attendees at the Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School. In the same year, I received the con.Scienze Award for writing one of the ten best Italian scientific research works during the master's thesis. In Septemberâ€”December 2022, I was a visiting postgraduate researcher at the University of Glasgow, School of Computing Science, Scotland. Since 2022, I have been an HuggingFace and Streamlit Student Ambassador.

I belong to a research group led by <b>Prof. Gianluca Moro</b>. Together with my colleagues, we design and develop state-of-the-art NLP solutions pursuing a vision focused on concretizing the much-desired birth of a new generation of artificial understanding, learning, explicit knowledge representation, and reasoning.

<blockquote>
    While technology is important, itâ€™s what we do with it that truly matters.
	â€”Muhammad Yunus, Nobel Peace Prize Winner

<blockquote>
    Language is at the heart of human intelligence. It therefore is and must be at the heart of our efforts to build artificial intelligence. No sophisticated AI can exist without mastery of language.
