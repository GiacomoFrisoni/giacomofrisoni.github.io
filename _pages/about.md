I'm a PhD Student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Bologna. I investigate how to combine language models and structured knowledge for Natural Language Processing and Understanding (NLP/NLU) in Health domains.

I work on interpretable text mining, knowledge graph learning, semantic parsing, event extraction, graph representation and similarity learning, graph verbalization, knowledge injection, retrieval-enhanced language models, and joint text-graph reasoning via graph neural networks.
My contributions cover a wide variety of real-world tasks, from open-domain question answering to single- and multi-document summarization.

We live in a unique time for computer science and artificial intelligence. Nowadays there has been a profound evolution of the NLP sector which led to the achievement of goals deemed insurmountable until recently.
My objective is to concretize the much-desired birth of a new generation of artificial understanding, integrating learning, knowledge representation, reasoning, and explanation.
